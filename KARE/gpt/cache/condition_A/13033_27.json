Type 2 diabetes can predispose patients to acute kidney injury through chronic hyperglycemia\u2011induced vascular and tubular damage, making the kidneys more vulnerable to hemodynamic stress. Conversely, hypovolemia decreases renal perfusion and can directly precipitate acute kidney failure. Recognizing that both type 2 diabetes and low intravascular volume are important clinical contributors to acute kidney failure guides clinicians to monitor diabetic patients closely, ensure adequate hydration, and intervene promptly to preserve renal function."

        "content": "Hemodialysis is linked to a range of acute and chronic complications that often present with a sudden\u2011onset clinical course. Acute disorder of hemodialysis arises as a direct consequence of the dialysis procedure itself and typically follows a rapid, abrupt clinical trajectory. A similar pattern is seen with the first\u2011use syndrome of dialysis, another complication that occurs when patients are exposed to hemodialysis for the first time; this syndrome also manifests suddenly after initiation of treatment. Both of these entities are closely related to dialysis\u2011associated disequilibrium syndrome (\u0645\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0632\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u063a\u0633\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0649), which is characterized by an abrupt onset and is explicitly described as having a sudden clinical course. In addition to these acute presentations, hemodialysis is clinically associated with several chronic conditions. Patients undergoing long\u2011term dialysis frequently exhibit chronic hypertension, persistent impairment of kidney function (\u0627\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0648\u0638\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0649), and microcytic anemia (\u0641\u0642\u0631 \u062f\u0645 \u0635\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0627\u062a). Moreover, hemodialysis can precipitate or coexist with acute renal failure (\u0642\u0635\u0648\u0631 \u0643\u0644\u0648\u064a \u062d\u0627\u062f), underscoring the potential for severe renal compromise in this population. Beyond renal\u2011related sequelae, the concept of sudden onset is also applied to other ophthalmic pathology, such as sudden acquired retinal degeneration, which similarly follows an abrupt clinical course, highlighting that rapid symptom emergence is a common feature across diverse medical conditions. Overall, the interconnections among hemodialysis, its acute syndromes (acute disorder of hemodialysis, first\u2011use syndrome, dialysis disequilibrium syndrome), associated chronic disorders (chronic hypertension, kidney function disorder, microcytic anemia, acute renal failure), and the broader pattern of sudden\u2011onset clinical courses emphasize the importance of vigilant monitoring and prompt management of both immediate and long\u2011term complications in patients receiving hemodialysis."
